MusicFileRenamer
================
Python script that renames music files to be consistent. File formats supported are mp3 and flac. Must have Python 2.7 to be able to run this script. Renaming is based off of the file's metadata. Example format would be `01 - Title of Track`

Place the script in the directory of files you want renamed. Run the script by typing `python name.py` in a command prompt.
